description: Use when surveying a research topic or writing a grounded literature review, technology assessment, field assessment, SOTA report, or pros/cons report — explores the literature, builds a focused knowledge base with verified BibTeX, and can turn a populated knowledge base into a structured report
---

## Choose the mode

- **Explore and build the knowledge base:** run Topic Survey below.
- **Write up an existing survey:** when the user asks to "write up the survey", "write a review", assess a technology/field, or otherwise already has a populated project KB, skip Topic Survey and start at Survey Report.
- **Explore, fetch, and write:** complete Topic Survey, invoke `download-ref --from-bib`, then continue directly to Survey Report in this same skill when the user wants the write-up.

## Topic Survey

Before starting this mode, check which lawful literature sources are available (arXiv, Crossref, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, publisher pages, etc.). Use available project tools directly; ask the user only when a source choice materially changes the result. Never use Sci-Hub or bypass access controls. If no academic source connector is configured, use web search and explicitly report the limitation.

If the user already provided a research topic or question, skip the clarification step.

**Step 1 — Clarify.** Ask one question to narrow the research topic. Give 2-4 choice options.

**Step 2 — Pick strategies & search.** Present the strategy menu to the user as a multi-select question. Recommend 3-4 strategies based on the topic context, but let the user choose. Then run one search worker per selected strategy in parallel when available, or sequentially otherwise. Each worker uses **broad web search only** at this stage — fast and exploratory.

**Strategy menu:**

| # | Strategy | When to use |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Landscape mapping** | First iteration default — broad field overview |
| 2 | **Adjacent subfield** | Deep-dive into a neighboring cluster identified in prior iteration |
| 3 | **Cross-vocabulary** | Abstract away jargon, search other fields for the same structural problem |
| 4 | **Cross-method** | Same problem, different computational or experimental approaches |
| 5 | **Historical lineage** | Who tried before, what failed, what changed since |
| 6 | **Negative results** | Search for papers showing what does not work |
| 7 | **Benchmarks and datasets** | What evaluation infrastructure exists |

When presenting to the user, briefly explain why you recommend each strategy for their specific topic (e.g., "Cross-vocabulary recommended because your problem — buffering stochastic supply — appears in operations research and hydrology too").

Each worker produces a short **findings report** — key papers found, grouped by sub-theme, with titles and one-line descriptions. No BibTeX yet. **Important:** workers must also collect the DOI and arXiv ID for each paper when visible in search results (e.g., DOIs from publisher URLs, arXiv IDs from arxiv.org links like `2401.12345`). Record these alongside titles in the findings report.

**Step 3 — Consolidate & user picks directions.** Main agent consolidates all findings reports. **Deduplicate** papers that appear in multiple strategy reports — match by title similarity or DOI. Merge their descriptions (keep the richer one), **preserve any DOIs and arXiv IDs collected** during Step 2, and note which strategies found each paper. Then present the consolidated findings as numbered options grouped by theme. Ask: "Which directions should I add to the knowledge base? Pick one or more." The user can select multiple.

**Step 4 — Build KB entries.** For the selected directions only, generate the BibTeX. **Never generate BibTeX from memory** — always verify against an authoritative source.

**KB resolution.** The target KB is the project KB by default — `<project>/.knowledge/` unless the user overrides the directory name via `$SCIBRAIN_KB_DIRNAME`:

```sh
KB=$(python3 .agents/skills/download-ref/helpers/resolve_kb.py)
```

If `KB` is empty (resolve_kb printed `unresolvable from ...`), ask the user via `a direct user question` for an explicit path. When invoked from `/incarnate` against a specific advisor, override via `KB=$(python3 .agents/skills/download-ref/helpers/resolve_kb.py --advisor <slug>)` so the path follows `$SCIBRAIN_KB_DIRNAME` too.

Ensure `$KB/.raw/arxiv/` and `$KB/.raw/doi/` exist (`mkdir -p`).

**Pre-sort the picks.** Split selected papers into:

- **ID-known papers** — DOI or arXiv ID was collected during Steps 2-3
- **ID-unknown papers** — neither was found

**arxiv MCP fast path.** If an arxiv MCP with `export_papers` is configured, batch-export papers with arXiv IDs via `export_papers(arxiv_ids, format="bibtex", include_abstract=True)` and remove them from the lists below.

**Lookup path A — ID-known papers (batch lookup).**

1. Single batch call to Semantic Scholar:
   ```
   POST https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/batch?fields=title,authors,year,journal,abstract,externalIds,citationStyles
   Body: {"ids": ["DOI:10.xxxx/yyyy", "ARXIV:2401.12345", ...]}
   ```
   Up to 500 ids per call.
2. **For each returned paper:** write the full response to `$KB/.raw/{arxiv,doi}/<id>.json` in the exact JSON shape `fetch_metadata.py` produces (top-level keys: `title`, `authors`, `year`, `venue`, `abstract`, `externalIds`, `citationStyles`, `openAccessPdf`). Use `<safe-doi>` (DOI with `/` → `-`) for the filename in `.raw/doi/`.
3. For papers returning `null` from the batch, pick the single most effective fallback (CrossRef for DOI-only, title-match for others).

**Lookup path B — ID-unknown papers (title-based lookup).**

For each paper, pick the single most effective method (Semantic Scholar title match, CrossRef, MCP servers, WebFetch publisher page). On success, write the result to `$KB/.raw/{arxiv,doi}/<id>.json` in the same shape as lookup path A.

**Step 4 finalize — bib + INDEX.**

After both lookup paths complete, for each new ref:

```sh
# Get the auto-proposed key from the JSON.
KEY=$(python3 .agents/skills/download-ref/helpers/append_bibtex.py propose \
        --kb "$KB" --id "$ID" --type "$TYPE" | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["proposed_key"])')
# Append to the KB's references.bib (dedup is free — refuses duplicates).
python3 .agents/skills/download-ref/helpers/append_bibtex.py append \
  --kb "$KB" --id "$ID" --type "$TYPE" --key "$KEY" \
  --bib "$KB/references.bib"
```

Skip per-ref user confirmation — at survey scale (30+ refs) it's unworkable, and survey is the authority for its own cite keys.

Finally, regenerate `INDEX.md`:

```sh
python3 .agents/skills/download-ref/helpers/index.py \
  --kb "$KB" \
  --title "<topic-slug> — references" \
  --source-note "Built by /survey on $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)."
```

**Write NOTES.md.** Write or extend `$KB/NOTES.md` with three sections:

- **Field landscape** — key papers clustered by sub-theme with years, active groups, temporal trends. Reference papers as `[@<cite-key>]`.
- **Key open problems** — unsolved questions.
- **Key bottlenecks** — obstacles preventing progress.

If `NOTES.md` already exists, **extend** rather than overwrite: merge new findings into existing sections, preserve user edits.

**Extending an existing KB** (Survey was run before on this project): read `$KB/references.bib` first; skip papers already present (match by DOI or exact title); append only new entries.

If the survey reveals the idea is already published, present the prior art and ask the user if they see a different angle before proceeding.

## After Survey — fetch full text, then optionally write

The discovery stage is done once the KB has its references, `NOTES.md`, and `INDEX.md`. Use `download-ref` to fetch PDFs and render full-text markdown before writing a source-grounded report.

First, scan the conversation for arXiv IDs / DOIs the user mentioned that the parallel search didn't surface. If any are missing from `references.bib`, pull them in (invoke `download-ref` single-shot, cite-key confirmation per ref) so the reference set is complete before downloading.

Then offer the next step:

> "Survey complete. Fetch the PDFs?"
> - **(a)** Fetch + render all refs — invokes `download-ref --from-bib $KB/references.bib --kb $KB`; after it finishes, offer to continue to Survey Report below.
> - **(b)** Done — stop here.

## Survey Report

Write a self-contained survey or technology/field assessment suitable for internal decision-making or team onboarding. This mode can follow Topic Survey in the same conversation or run directly against an existing project KB.

### Setup

Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/writing-workflow.md` for context loading, **source scoping**, citation handling, gap-filling research, output format, diagrams, and finish checks.

- If no KB exists, offer to run Topic Survey first; the report needs a grounded reference base.
- **Scope the source set first.** Run `scope_refs.py` as specified in the shared workflow. Fix dangling anchors before drafting. Build the report's approaches and claims from those scoped keys, not the entire bibliography.
- Check `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` for a deliverables-location convention before choosing an output path.
- Tailor technical depth to the user's role from `docs/discussion/user-profile.md` or available context.
- Save to `articles/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-review.{md,typ,tex}` or a project-specific path if the user prefers.
- For Typst, start from `.agents/skills/survey/template.typ` with `.agents/skills/survey/template.bib`. The scaffold provides `section_box`, `stage`, `proscons`, `compare_table`, and `problem_table`; delete unused helpers from the copied document.

### Gap-filling focus

- Missing SOTA results mentioned in the survey but lacking citations
- Key groups or companies active in the field but not yet referenced
- Approaches or method families that belong in the technical assessment but are not covered
- Results from the last six months that may have superseded older survey entries

### Drafting flow

When the source set comes from an existing, recent `NOTES.md` (the normal case), draft the whole report end-to-end and show the compiled result for one review round. Reserve section-by-section drafting for a cold start where no `NOTES.md` exists and the substance is being composed as you go.

Organize the review **by technical approach**. State of the art and trade-offs live inside each approach, not in separate global sections. Do not add standalone global "Pros and Cons" or "State of the Art" sections.

#### 1. What and Why

Define the topic in 2–3 paragraphs for a new reader:

- What it is and what problem it solves
- Why it matters now
- How it differs from the dominant or prior approach

Include a diagram only when it clarifies the architecture, data flow, or problem framing. Lay approaches side by side only when they solve the same task and are genuinely comparable; otherwise show their relationship or omit the figure.

#### 2. Technical Approaches

Identify the main method families (typically 3–6) and give one subsection per approach. Optionally begin with a short field-wide timeline or landscape.

For each approach, cover:

- **What it is** — the defining representation, objective, or mechanism.
- **State of the art** — strongest current results, leading groups, and maturity, each cited. Lead with the best result rather than a chronology.
- **Assessment** — genuine strengths and limitations, with citations. Use the `proscons` two-list style only for competing solutions to the same problem. For complementary capabilities, platform branches, or historical stages, use a short prose assessment instead.

Optionally finish with a cross-approach comparison table when several approaches share meaningful criteria. Choose columns that actually discriminate this field (for example scalability, verifiability/cost, maturity, and best-fit use case). Skip it for a single-approach topic.

#### 3. Open Problems

End with a ranked table of 4–8 problems: number, problem, why it matters, who could solve it, and urgency (Critical / High / Medium). Cite the work that defines each gap or the closest existing result. Do not add business strategy, product fit, or investor sections to the neutral report.

### Visualization guidelines

- Typst: use CeTZ for timelines and dependency diagrams; use native `grid`, `rect`, and fixed-width `box()` for text-heavy comparisons and role diagrams. See `.agents/skills/_shared/typst-reference.md`.
- Use a native table for cross-approach comparisons.
- Wrap multiline CeTZ content in a fixed-width box and use string identifiers for `name:`.
- Compile after each figure; every claim in technical and open-problem tables needs at least one citation.

### Optional direction fit

After showing the report, ask exactly once: "Do you want me to analyse which direction is most suited for you?"

If yes, load the user's profile (or collect brief background, strengths, assets, and goals if none exists) and recommend 2–4 ranked directions. For each, name the report section/problem, explain the specific fit, give the smallest first experiment, and say what to avoid. Keep this personalized analysis outside the neutral report.
